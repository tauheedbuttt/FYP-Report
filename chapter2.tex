\section{Zameen.com}
\cite{zameen} This is the leading real estate based application in Pakistan. Customers have developed strong belief in it for their search in real estate projects. However, it only connects the client with the owner. Client is unable to make payments through the app and keep them in track. Neither Owner can manage those payments through the application. This is the point where Estate+ will differ from it and attract those long lasting users of Zameen.com. \\[0.5cm]
\section{Graana}
\cite{graana} It is also a similar real estate application compared to Zameen.com. It also only connects client and owner together rather than providing them ability to make payments. This point can also be used in the proposed project's favour and establish a strong position in it.
