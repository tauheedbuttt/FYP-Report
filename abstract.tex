Estate+ is a cross platform application built to cater a real estate projectâ€™s
client and owner needs. It allows users to place a booking in real estate projects
that have already completed their construction or still in one. The owners of
such projects can also post their ads on the app for the clients to see. Installments paid by clients are also approved through the application as the admin
of the owner authenticates them through a web portal. Owner gets to create
admin accounts who manage their projects for them through the Web Portal.
Admins further get support from Customer Relation Officers who can chat with
users to deal with their queries through the same portal.
